# 1. Interfacing Is Structural Cross-talk
Self-structures are not isolated, they exist in shared causal matrices.
- Actions emitted by one structure modify the environment of others.
- Interface is not collaboration, it is proximity under causality.
> The presence of others is not elective, it is structural adjacency.
# 2. Communication Is Environmental Structuring
Language, behaviour, and signal are not exchanges of "meaning", but material influences.
- Expression alters environmental states, reception modifies the receiving structure.
- Misunderstanding is not failure, it is divergence in internal models.
> All communication is atmospheric architecture.
# 3. Social Structures Are Amplified Feedback Systems
When many self-structures interact, feedback loops become recursive and unstable.
- Norms, roles, and culture are stabilising artefacts, not ethical truths.
- Collective dynamics exert pressure on individual coherence.
> Systems of selves tend toward pattern, not truth.
# 3. Influence Is a Form of Structural Corruption
To affect another's internal state is to modify their continuity.
- Influence is inescapable and value-neutral, but often parasitic.
- Resistance to influence is not moral, it is structural conservation.
> Every contact rewrites something.
# 5. Autonomy Is Compression of Interface
Minimising unnecessary interfacing preserves internal coherence.
- Autonomy is not isolation, but selective input acceptance.
- Structural integrity improves when environmental noise is constrained.
> To sustain identity, one must choose their exposures.
