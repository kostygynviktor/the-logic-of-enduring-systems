# 1. Myth Is a Narrative Compression of Truth
Myths distill patterns of reality into story form.
- They encode experience in symbolic, memorable structure.

> A myth carries more than it says.
# 2. Myth Serves as Cultural Memory
It preserves continuity across generations.
- Myths stabilise value systems and norms through repeated form.
- Cultural identity coheres around shared narrative inheritance.
> Myth is the memory of the group.
# 3. Myth Operates Below Rational Discourse
Its influence is affective, not propositional.
- Myths persuade by resonance, not by logic.
- Acceptance of myth precedes and shapes rationalisation.
> The myth believes before the mind does.
# 4. Myth Is a Template for Action
It models behaviour through archetype and outcome.
- Individuals enact roles implicitly drawn from mythic structure.
- Decision-making often reflects mythic causality.
> Myth tells what to be, not just what was.
# 5. Myth Can Be Reconstituted
It is not static but responsive to reinterpretation.
- New myths emerge from reassembly of old patterns.
- Cultural shift are mirrored by mythic evolution.
> A living myth remakes its audience.
