# 1. Ethics as Predictive System Modelling
Ethics is not about what "should" be done, but what will or must occur under given constraints.
- Ethical behaviour is structurally emergent from internal configurations and environmental contingencies.
- Prescriptions are compressions of causally-expected sequences, not commands.
> Ethics is the modelling of expected outcomes under structure-bound causality, not a doctrine of right action.
# 2. Moral Language is Heuristic, Not Foundational
Terms like "good", "bad", or "wrong" are structurally invalid, they are shorthand for structural preference outcomes.
- These terms may aid coordination or correction but lack ontological status.
- They persist only due to their social utility, not objective meaning.
> Moral terms are compression tools, not ontological truths; they refer to structure-relative consequences.
# 3. Intervention is Structural, Not Moral
When systems intervene in others, it is a causal interaction, not a moral obligation.
- Intervention is the result of a system's structure intersecting with another's instability, threat, or entanglement.
- There is no intrinsic duty, only compatibility, risk, or systemic feedback prompting action.
> Intervention arises from entangled structures, not ethical imperatives.
# 4. Reciprocity is Emergent, Not Inherent
Reciprocal behaviours emerge from mutual structural incentives, not from obligation or justice.
- Systems engage in reciprocity when feedback loops reinforce mutual continuity.
- Altruism is structurally self-interested when viewed across system time.
> Reciprocity is not virtue; it is structural feedback maintaining inter-system stability.
# 5. Ethical Norms Are Environmentally Bounded
Ethical norms are localised rule-sets derived from structure-environment interaction patterns.
- No norm is universally valid, only locally functional.
- Exported norms degrade in unfamiliar systems and conditions.
> Norms are environmental tools, not universal truths; they function only within specific structural alignments.
