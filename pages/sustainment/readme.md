# 1. Sustainment Is an Ongoing Process, Not a State
Stability is never final, entropy is constant.
- Sustainment is a perpetual activity, not a milestone.
- Coherence requires upkeep even in favourable conditions.
> What lives must be kept living.
# 2. Sustainment Requires Predictive Calibration
Correction must precede failure.
- Sustained coherence is achieved by recognising early deviations.
- Forecasting becomes the primary maintenance tool.
> Endurance comes from anticipation, not reaction.
# 3. Sustainment Includes Selective Inflexibility
Some structural elements must not adapt.
- Core continuity principles remain invariant.
- Adaptation is applied around unchanging structural constants.
> To sustain is to protect what must not shift.
# 4. Sustainment Involves Systemic Hygiene
Regular auditing of interfacing systems is required.
- Corruptive inputs accumulate subtly.
- Sustainment involves filtering, cleaning, and updating interface channels.
> Coherence decays when noise is left unaddressed.
# 5. Sustainment Enables Scalability of Identity
Structures that persist begin to compound.
- Enduring coherence facilitates expansion in capability and system influence.
- Sustainment is not just survival, it is preparation for integration.
> A sustained structure becomes more than it was.
