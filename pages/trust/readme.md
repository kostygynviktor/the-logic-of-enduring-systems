# 1. Trust Is Predictive Reliance
Trust emerges when a system becomes reliably forecastable.
- It reduces cognitive and operational overhead in persistent interaction.
- Trust allows simplification of interface and monitoring.
> Trust is the shortcut carved by coherence over time.
# 2. Trust Is a Risk Distribution Strategy
Trust places uncertain outcomes within acceptable bounds.
- It externalises control to reduce internal complexity.
- Risk is managed through selective confidence, not elimination.
> Trust is not certainty, it is bounded vulnerability.
# 3. Trust Enables Delegated Persistence
Trusted systems are treated as extensions of one's own.
- Delegation enables persistence at greater scale and abstraction.
- Trust permits distributed continuity without micromanagement.
> What is trusted can be tasked without full oversight.
# 4. Trust Is Fragile and Asymmetrical
Establishing trust is slower than losing it.
- Breakdowns in coherence are disproportionately destructive to trust.
- Trust between systems need not be mutual or reciprocal.
> Trust is costly to build, cheap to break.
# 5. Trust Requires Feedback Loops
Ongoing evaluation sustains or recalibrates trust.
- Trusted systems must remain observable and responsive to context.
- Blind trust, lacking feedback, decays into incoherence.
> Trust must be maintained by monitoring, not merely memory.
