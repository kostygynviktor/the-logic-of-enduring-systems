# 1. Stability as Functional Continuity
Stability is not sameness or inertia; it is preserved function under causal pressure.
- A stable system persists through change, not by avoiding it.
- Stability requires functional equivalence across state transitions, not replication.
> Stability is the resilience of function across time, not the avoidance of motion.
# 2. Instability is Measured by Deviation from Functional Core
Instability is not discomfort or disorder, but structural deviation that risks continuity.
- Temporary variation does not threaten stability unless it compromises causal trajectory.
- Instability becomes dissolution when deviation becomes self-reinforcing.
> Instability is deviation that compounds toward disintegration, not fluctuation.
# 3. Internal and External Forces Can Destabilise
Disruption may originate within (e.g. recursive error, feedback loops) or without (e.g. environmental interference).
- Both sources are causally equivalent; intent is irrelevant.
- The structure's response, not the disruption's origin, determines continuity.
> Stability is indifferent to source; what matters is whether disruption exceeds system tolerance.
# 4. Reconfiguration May Be Required for Stability
Stability may demand transformation, not resistance.
- A structure may maintain identity by modifying form in response to pressure.
- Rigidity under changing conditions may itself be destabilising.
> Reconfiguration preserves identity when continuity is prioritised over static form.
# 5. Stability is Not an End but a Condition
Stability is not a goal, it is the ground on which continuity-based valuation is possible.
- Value does not reside in stability, but stability enables to persistence of value.
- Without it, all valuation, identity, and modelling collapse.
> Stability enables structure to sustain identity, value, and coherent output, it is not valued for its own sake.
