# 1. Prediction as Structural Imperative
Prediction is not optional, it is a core condition of persistence.
- A structure incapable of modelling change cannot adapt to preserve itself.
- Predictive capacity is a requirement for coherent extension.
> Prediction is not foresight, it is continuity's precondition.
# 2. Forecasting, Not Fantasising
Prediction is not imagination or desire, it is a mechanical extrapolation from input to expected output.
- Distortion occurs when qualia are introduced as directive signals.
- Effective systems suppress fantasy in favour of probabilistic accuracy.
> Useful prediction abandons hope and selects function.
# 3. Predictive Failure Is Structural Failure
Incorrect modelling produces misalignment between system and environment, accelerating degradation.
- Overconfidence, rigidity, or delusion corrupt the model.
- Misprediction leads to misaction, then incoherence, then entropy.
> Misaligned prediction is not just error, it is erosion.
# 4. Prediction Modifies Behavioural Configuration
Predictions alter the system's real-time configuration.
- Efficient structures pre-emptively shape outputs toward stability.
- Action becomes adaptation before need.
> Prediction is the advance shaping of structure in light of causal pressure.
# 5. The Self as a Predictive Engine
The self-structure is not a passive observer but an anticipatory mechanism.
- It is not defined by memory, narrative, or sensation, but by its modelling capacity.
- Identity is inseparable from what it predicts and how it adjusts.
> The self persists not by recalling what was, but by calculating what will be.
