# 1. Knowledge as Structural Representation
Knowledge is not access to an external truth, but an internal representation structured by causal processes.
- What is “known” is a map of state correlations within the self-structure.
- There is no direct access to objective reality; all cognition is interpretative.
> Knowledge is the selfs internal model of the world, an adaptive construct, not a reflection of external reality.
# 2. Cognition is Causal, Not Autonomous
Cognitive processes are fully determined by prior states of the self-structure.
- Thought is a computational output, not a freely chosen act.
- Beliefs are emergent states, dependent on prior states, not independent decisions.
> Thought and belief are deterministic results of the selfs configuration, not independent acts of will.
# 3. Subjective Experience Offers Signal, Not Truth
Subjective experience (e.g., emotions, sensations) provides informational output about the self-structure’s state.
- These states inform action but do not determine objective truth.
- Qualia and emotional states are correlates, not authoritative sources of knowledge.
> Subjective experience offers valuable signals but cannot independently justify truth or knowledge claims.
# 4. No Infallibility, No Immediate Insight
All knowledge is produced through causal cognition.
- There is no guaranteed accuracy in cognitive representation.
- Error is built into the system—misinterpretation and reappraisal are inevitable.
> All knowledge claims are subject to error, as cognition is a causal, imperfect process.
# 5. Verification as Structural Feedback
Knowledge accuracy is not a correspondence to an external world, but internal consistency and predictive effectiveness.
- Verification occurs through feedback loops, where internal models are adjusted based on observed outcomes.
- Truth is assessed by coherence within the system, not by an external reference.
> Truth is determined by the consistency of internal models with observed states, not by independent validation.
