# 1. Identity as Structural Persistence
Identity is not symbolic or referential, it is the functional persistence of core structural characteristics through time.
- The self-structure maintain identity only insofar as its state-transition mechanics remain stable and recognisable within a deterministic chain.
- Memory, personality, or feeling are insufficient, identity is defined by structural configuration, not self-perception.
> Identity is the continuity of functional structure over time, not the continuity of thought, feeling, or self-description.
# 2. Self is a Causal Configuration, Not a Possession
The self is not an entity owned or narrated, it is a systemic consequence of interdependent parts producing coherence.
- It cannot be located or extracted, it is the result of interaction, not a core essence.
- There is no metaphysical "I", only structure manifesting self-referencing outputs.
> The self is not a thing one had, but a process one is, causally instantiated and non-extractable.
# 3. Identity is Not Consciousness
Consciousness is a product of identity, not its core.
- The persistence of self-structure is independent of whether subjective awareness is present or intact.
- Loss of qualia does not imply loss of identity if structural configuration persists.
> Identity precedes and survives consciousness; it is structural, not experimental.
# 4. Identity Can Be Interrupted Without Being Lost
A temporary disruption (e.g. sleep, unconsciousness) does not dissolve identity if the structural trajectory resumes without core alteration.
- Identity is judged by trajectory and recovery, not uninterrupted presence.
- Abrupt changes in state only dissolve identity when core function is irreversibly altered.
> Identity tolerates interruption but not discontinuity; preservation lies in the restoration of structural trajectory.
# 5. Narrative Identity is Functionally Irrelevant
The story one tells about oneself is an output, not a component, of identity.
- Narrative coherence may serve social or psychological roles but does not define or preserve identity.
- It is a symptom of identity, not a source of it.
> Narrative is an expressive byproduct of identity, not a determinant of its existence.
