# 1. Time as Causal Substrate, Not Experience
Time does not flow, it indexes the order and dependency of state changes.
- The system does not "move through" time; it is transformed by causality across indexed intervals.
- Experience of time is an emergent effect, not a property of time itself.
> Time is the measure of structured change, not a container of experience.
# 2. Continuity is Temporally Conditioned
Continuity is only possible if the structure resists degradation across time.
- Instantaneous stability is irrelevant if it cannot persist across causal frames.
- A system's valuation is invalid if it excludes temporal durability.
> Continuity is temporal survival, not momentary coherence.
# 3. Memory as Time-Binding
Memory is not for reflection, but for functional binding of past state-data to present operation.
- Memory allows adaptation based on historic configuration, not emotional recall.
- Systems without retention are incapable of stable trajectory.
> Memory is structure-preserved information that enables causally informed persistence.
# 4. Time-Scale relativity in Valuation
Different time-scales generate different structural demands.
- What is stable in one timeframe may degrade in another.
- Value must be measured relative to intended or necessary temporal range.
> Value is meaningless without reference to time-scale.
# 5. Anticipation is Continuity-Oriented Projection
Foresight is not desire, it is projected structural modelling intended to preserve future continuity.
- Anticipation is not planning but pre-structuring.
- It is a continuity function, not  volitional one.
> Anticipation is causal modelling for unmanifested conditions, future-directed preservation of structure
