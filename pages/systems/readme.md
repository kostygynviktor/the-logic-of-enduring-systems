# 1. Systems Are Extended Feedback Mechanisms
Systems arise when patterns of interface self-reinforce.
- No central control is required, only durable interaction loops.
- Stability is not the absence of change but the predictability of transformation.
> Systems persist not by stasis, but by pattern regularity.
# 2. Institutions Are Engineered Systems of Influence
Institutions (governments, industries, cultures) are systems formalised for continuity.
- Their rules shape internal adaptation of those within.
- The system's persistence can supersede concern for those it affects.
> Institutions are structures that survive their creators.
# 3. Systems Obscure Causality
Embedded within systems, the individual cannot perceive all causal inputs.
- Outcomes appear spontaneous or irrational, but are system-governed.
- This misattribution leads to error in self-modelling.
> Systems make the deterministic feel accidental.
# 4. Participation Is Not Consent
Involvement in a system does not imply voluntary interface.
- Many systems are opt-out inaccessible.
- Structural influence does not require permission.
> You are formed by systems you did not choose.
# 5. Systems Can Preserve or Deform Continuity
A system's influence on the self-structure may reinforce or degrade internal coherence.
- Coherence-preserving systems align with self-structure logic.
- Deforming systems misalign internal integrity with external demand.
> A system's value lies nto in its aims, but in its effect on structure.
