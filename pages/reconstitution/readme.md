# 1. Reconstitution Is Not Restoration
The original structure cannot be recovered, only functionally restabilised.
- Identity persists through coherence, not sameness.
- Recovery is measured by continuity, not resemblance.
> Reconstitution rebuilds the bridge, not the exact path.
# 2. Reconstitution Requires Stabilised Input Conditions
Rebuilding is impossible under persistent deformation.
- First condition: cessation or regulation of corrupting interface.
- Environmental control is prerequisite to self-structural coherence.
> A collapsing house cannot be repaired mid-quake.
# 3. Structural Debris Must Be Identified and Extracted
Residual distortions interfere with reformation.
- Maladaptive beliefs, behaviours, and feedback loops must be made inert.
- What cannot be integrated must be removed.
> Reconstitution discards what continuity cannot use.
# 4. Reconstitution Utilises Fragments of Prior Structure
Not all is lost, internal logic can persist beneath incoherence.
- These fragments become anchors in the reconstruction process.
- The task is not to build anew, but to extend from what remains viable.
> Continuity survives in pieces, not wholes.
# 5. Reconstitution Alters Identity Without Violating It
The post-collapse structure differs in form but not in function.
- It is still "you", because the logic of coherence remains uninterrupted.
- The boundary of identity is determined by causal alignment, not memory or perception.
> Identity is not a face, it is a function preserved through change.
