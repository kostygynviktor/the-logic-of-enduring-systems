# 1. Meaning Is a Functional Pattern of Relevance
Meaning is not inherent, it is enacted.
- It emerges through recurrent alignment between input and internal structure.
- Meaning serves prediction, coherence, and continuity.
> What is meaningful is what stabilises orientation.
# 2. Meaning Is Provisional and Context-Bound
No meaning is fixed outside of system and context.
- Interpretive frames are dynamic, shaped by situation.
- A signal's relevance depends on environment and intention.
> Nothing means anything by itself.
# 3. Meaning Is Shared by Convention
Communication relies on mutually learned mappings.
- Shared meaning stabilises cooperation.
- Collective coherence is built from repeated consensual patterns.
> To mean something to others is to share a structure.
# 4. Meaning Accumulates Through Narrative
Sequences confer significance retroactively.
- The position of a signal in time alters its weight.
- Meaning is shaped by trajectory and resolution.
> Later frames redefine earlier inputs.
# 5. Meaning Guides Behavioural Priority
What matters most dictates response first.
- Meaning ranks signals in order of system relevance.
- Action is a filter through which meaning proves durable.
> To mean something is to compel an orientation.
