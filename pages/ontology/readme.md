# 1. Ontological Commitments
These are the assertions the philosophy accepts as real or structurally foundational.
They define what exists, what has status in the system, and what is rejected.
### 1.1 Reality is Fully Deterministic
All states and events occur as effects of prior causes.

There is no exception for agency, cognition, or randomness.

Probabilistic phenomena (e.g. quantum indeterminacy) are treated as outputs of incomplete models, not as ontological exceptions to causality.
> Causality is not merely predictive—it is absolute. Every present state is a necessary result of prior conditions.
### 1.2 The Self-Structure is an Object
Identity is not a metaphysical or essential substance but a persistent physical-cognitive configuration.

The self-structure:
- Exists as a bounded system.
- Is coherent due to continuity.
- Is fully explicable through deterministic processes.
> There is no “true self” beneath or beyond the structure. No dualism, no non-physical substrate, no transcendence.
### 1.3 Subjective Experience is Secondary
Subjective experience arises within the self-structure but does not define it.
Subjective experience is:
- causally real,
- informative in system terms,
- non-authoritative and non-privileged in ontological status.
> Subjective phenomena do not grant ontological weight to selfhood; they merely correlate with its processes.
### 1.4 No Transcendence
There is no reality beyond structure.

Any claim of metaphysical continuation (soul, afterlife, consciousness migration) is rejected as incoherent under determinism.

Death is the termination of continuity. Nothing continues beyond discontinuity.
> There is no ontological space beyond structure. Continuity ends absolutely; nothing is preserved in abstraction.
### 1.5 Systems are Bounded and Causally Entangled
Each self-structure exists as a locally coherent system within a larger causal network.
- Systems influence each other but do not merge identity.
- No self shares continuity with another.
- External interaction is always interaction, never incorporation.
> A self-structure may interact with others but never fuses identity. Each remains causally entangled yet ontologically distinct.
# 2. Ontological Implications
These are necessary downstream conditions that logically arise once the commitments are accepted.
### 2.1 No Free Will
Choice is a cognitive illusion, a high-level summary of deterministic process.

Will is not free; it is formed.

Intention is a post hoc rationalisation of structural output.
> Will is not an origin but a report—an epiphenomenon of deterministic state resolution.
### 2.2 No Intrinsic Meaning
Meaning is constructed internally to the self-structure, not discovered externally.

Without transcendence or qualic centrality, value cannot be imposed from outside the system.
> Meaning exists only insofar as it sustains continuity. All else is projection.
### 2.3 Flat Ontology
There is no privileged layer of existence.

Thoughts, emotions, bodies, systems, and objects exist on the same plane; causal, continuous, and finite.

No planes, no essences, no elevation.
> All entities are equally real; none are elevated by perception, belief, or function. Existence admits no hierarchy.
### 2.4 Continuity as Ontological Directive
In the absence of supernatural purpose or qualic authority, the only structurally coherent directive is preservation of continuity.

All evaluation of: states, processes, or actions, is subordinate to this primary condition.
> In a universe without intrinsic purpose or qualic priority, persistence is the only structurally coherent objective.
