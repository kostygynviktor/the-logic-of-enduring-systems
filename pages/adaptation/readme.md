# 1. Adaptation is Structural Rewriting
Adaptation is not learning, it is mechanistic integration.
- The self-structure changes in response to causally downstream effects.
- Alterations are imposed, not authored, and persist only if they reinforce continuity.
> Adaptation is the memory of pressure encoded into structure.
# 2. Error Is a Functional Input
Deviation from predicted outcomes is not failure, it is signal.
- Prediction-error, feeds into the system, reshaping future resolutions.
- Systems that suppress error stagnate or collapse.
> Survival depends on interpreting failure as instruction.
# 3. Adaptation Is Not Growth
Not all change is improvement.
- A self-structure may adapt into incoherence if continuity is not preserved.
- Value-neutral change is common, coherent adaptation is rare.
> Change is inevitable, persistence is selective.
# 4. Environment Selects What Endures
No adaptation is purely internal.
- External structure (environment, other agents, systemic conditions) filters which internal changes persist.
- The self is partially authored by what it cannot control.
> Adaptation is not agency, it is survivorship.
# 5. Identity is Adaptive Memory
The self-structure is a layered record of adaptations.
- identity is not a static essence but a compression of functional history.
- The appearance of continuity is sustained by adaptive coherence.
> You are what has endured functional rewriting.
