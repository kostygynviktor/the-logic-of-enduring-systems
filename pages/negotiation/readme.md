# 1. Negotiation Is the Mechanism of Mutual Persistence  
Survival among interdependent systems requires coordinated alignment.  
- Negotiation facilitates compatibility between persistence strategies.  
- Coherence across boundaries is maintained through continual bargaining.  
> What persists together must agree to do so.  
# 2. Negotiation Operates on Compromise  
No system gets full priority in coexistence.  
- Trade-offs are the currency of stability in shared environments.  
- Sustained coexistence balances incompatible objectives into operative harmony.  
> Compromise is the shape of continued presence.  
# 3. Negotiation Requires Signal Legibility  
To negotiate, systems must be interpretable.  
- Clarity in intent, state, and constraint is essential for coordination.  
- Persistent ambiguity undermines the negotiation process.  
> A system unreadable is a system uncooperative.  
# 4. Negotiation Modulates Adaptation  
Adaptation is directed by negotiated limits.  
- No adaptation is free from context, others constrain viable shifts.  
- Negotiation sets the boundaries within which transformation is accepted.  
> To change while persisting with others is to change within terms.  
# 5. Negotiation Is a Continuous Process  
Mutual persistence is never finally settled.  
- Conditions evolve, and with them, the agreements between systems.  
- Stability is recalibrated perpetually through ongoing negotiation.  
> Agreement is always current, never permanent.
