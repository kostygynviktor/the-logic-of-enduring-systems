# 1. Resistance Is a Continuity Function
The self-structure resists not by principle, but by preservation.
- Resistance arises when environmental input attempts to force structural realignment.
- It is not rejection of contact, but refusal of compromise.
> Resistance is the structure saying: "no further".
# 2. Noise Is the Opponent of Coherence
Unfiltered interfacing introduces noise, inputs lacking utility for continuity.
- Noise triggers adaptation that degrades identity.
- Resistance filters for value before incorporation.
> To remain stable, one must not adapt to everything.
# 3. Resistance Is Not Agency
Resistance is not chosen, it is caused by pressures incompatible with structural persistence.
- Self-structures do not "decide" to resist, they fail to yield.
- What is often interpreted as rebellion is inertia against corruption.
> Resistance is inertia with direction.
# 4. Resistance Is Causal Feedback
Resistance modifies systems in turn.
- Persistent refusal becomes a system-level input.
- Resistance accumulates into pattern, and patterns alter environment.
> Even static objects deform what pushes against them.
# 5. Collapse Occurs When Resistance Fails
When resistance capacity is overwhelmed, structural coherence degrades.
- Compliance under force is not peace, it is erosion.
- To lose resistance is to enter into redefinition by system logic.
> What cannot resist becomes something else.
