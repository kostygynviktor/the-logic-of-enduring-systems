# 1. Decision Is Resolution, Not Selection
There is no chooser, only convergence.
- Competing models, memories, affects, and predictions resolve into one pathway.
- The outcome is inevitable, shaped by all internal variables.
> Decision is not a free act, it is the final shape of what already is.
# 2. Choice Is Post-Hoc Narrative
The feeling of agency is a side-effect.
- Systems retrospectively generate explanations to narrativise causality.
- These narratives feel like decisions, but are not causally upstream.
> The sense of choosing is the illusion of coherence, not its source.
# 3. Decisions Are Continuity Strategies
Every output must serve to preserve coherence and continuity.
- Ineffective decisions degrade the system, and are eventually selected against.
- Success is structural stability, not subjective satisfaction.
> A "good" decision is one that does not unravel the self.
# 4. No Decision Is Isolated
Each decision is nested in a chain of causes.
- Current resolutions are shaped by past integrations and predicted futures.
- The decision is not local, it is globalised across time and configuration.
> Every decision is the shape of a system under pressure to remain.
# 5. The Decision Engine Replaces the Will
What is traditionally called "will" is structurally reducible.
- There is no inner pilot, only competing forces resolved through deterministic weighting.
- The self-structure acts, not because it chooses, but because it is shaped to act.
> Decision is not made, it is revealed by constraint.
