# 1. Dependency Is the Foundation of Continuity  
No system exists in complete isolation.  
- Every persistence structure relies on external inputs.  
- Dependency is the basis upon which coherence is maintained.  
> Independence is always relative, never absolute.  
# 2. Dependency Shapes Structure  
What is depended upon determines internal form.  
- Systems contort to fit the reliability of their dependencies.  
- Structural design is biased by access, limitation, and source volatility.  
> A system grows in the shape of its needs.  
# 3. Dependency Demands Management  
Reliance requires oversight and failsafes.  
- Stable systems track, evaluate, and moderate their dependencies.  
- Dependencies left unexamined become vulnerabilities.  
> To persist, one must know what they lean on.  
# 4. Dependency Enables Complexity  
Advanced forms require layered support.  
- The more complex a system, the more interlinked its dependencies.  
- Managing dependency chains is critical to scaling coherence.  
> Complexity thrives where dependency is orchestrated.  
# 5. Dependency Introduces Risk  
Every reliance is a potential fault line.  
- The failure of what is depended upon can induce collapse.  
- Risk is the cost of extending coherence beyond self-sufficiency.  
> To depend is to wager continuity on others.
