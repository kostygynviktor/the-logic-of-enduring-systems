# 1. Attention Is Allocation, Not Awareness
Attention is not inherently conscious, it is a function of resource distribution.
- Processing is finite; prioritisation is structural, not elective.
- Attention occurs regardless of subjective experience.
> Attention is the mechanics of relevance, not awareness, not choice.
# 2. Relevance Is Causally Determined
What is attended to is not a matter of desire or interest, but causal weighting.
- Systems optimise for relevance to continuity, not for emotional novelty.
- Distraction is a failure of predictive coherence, not of will.
> Relevance is not selected, it emerges from structural configuration.
# 3. Attention Filters the Real
Only a fraction of inputs are processed with depth.
- The remainder is background noise, discarded or deferred.
- This filtering maintain system efficiency, but permits error and bias.
> Reality is narrowed by attention into a version the system can afford to track.
# 4. Misallocated Attention Risks Degradation
If attention is drawn to inputs that do not support coherence, the system destabilises.
- This includes compulsive stimuli, trauma feedback, or ideology.
- Efficiency is lost, and predictive alignment weakens.
> Attention is not free, it incurs cost, and poor investments risk collapse.
# 5. The Shape of the Self Is the Shape of Its Attention
What a system attends to defines its functional shape.
- Attention determines input, inputs determines change.
- The self is, in operational terms, the pattern of what it consistently foregrounds.
> The self is not where attention lands, it is what attention sustains.
