# 1. Reciprocity Structures Mutual Coherence  
Interaction is not neutral, it is balancing.  
- Systems that exchange must adapt to each otherâ€™s constraints.  
- Coherence stabilizes through iterative mutual calibration.  
> Exchange preserves form when both sides are altered.
# 2. Reciprocity Requires Memory and Forecast  
Each interaction references the past and anticipates the future.  
- Historical consistency informs present trust.  
- Forecasting shapes the allowable terms of exchange.  
> To reciprocate is to remember and project.
# 3. Reciprocity Is Not Equality  
Balance is not sameness, but negotiated asymmetry.  
- Each party offers what it uniquely possesses.  
- Reciprocity sustains difference through structure.  
> Uneven exchange can still be stable.
# 4. Reciprocity Is a Temporal Agreement  
The return does not need to be immediate.  
- Sustained systems tolerate asynchronous balance.  
- Time-delayed reciprocity builds deeper interdependence.  
> A promise can hold the weight of presence.
# 5. Reciprocity Is the Foundation of Social Systems  
Cooperative structures arise from maintained exchange.  
- Institutions are formalized patterns of reciprocity.  
- Civilisation itself is a complex reciprocal interface.  
> Society is sustained exchange scaled to abstraction.
