# 1. Narrative as Data Compression
Narrative is not truth, it is a method of simplifying complexity into linear causal relationships.
- Its function is interpretive coherence, not empirical fidelity.
- It reduces entropy for internal modelling, but introduces distortion.
> Narrative simplifies reality to preserve operational fluency, not to deliver accuracy.
# 2. Identity Is Not a Story
A system's identity is persistent function, not its recountable history.
- Tellings one's story is not being oneself.
- Narratives are optional overlays, not the architecture of self.
> Identity precedes narrative, it is a structure, not a story.
# 3. Narrative Serves Emotional Regulation
Narrative often arises as a homeostatic response, offering a stable frame to explain discomfort or uncertainty.
- It helps contain affect, but does not resolve causal conditions.
- Its utility lies in stability, not truth.
> narrative stabilises affect by offering causally plausible illusions.
# 4. Narrative Can Obstruct Structural Continuity
When narrative becomes authoritative, it can override functional adaptability.
- Rigid self-stories constrain reconfiguration.
- "Who I am" stories may preserve coherence of belief while sabotaging structural preservation.
> Narrative coherence is not structural coherence, it may preserve self-image while degrading the self.
# 5. Narrative as Tool, Not Core
Narrative is best used deliberately and temporarily, not held as an absolute.
- It is a compressive lens, not a mirror, map, or directive.
- Effective systems use narrative only insofar as it supports continuity.
> Narrative is a convenience, not a command, useful when subordinated to structural truth.
