# 1. Coherence as Structural Synchrony
Coherence is not about truth, but internal causal alignment.
- Divergent processes increase entropy and risk degradation.
- The system must resolve contradiction, not for comfort, but for stability.
> Coherence is the system's immunity to contradiction, not its agreement with feeling.
# 2. Emotional Coherence is Non-Authoritative
Affective alignment can be illusory coherence.
- Feeling "at peace" does not indicate structural soundness.
- Coherence is measured by operational continuity, not mood.
> Emotional agreement may accompany coherence, but cannot define it.
# 3. Incoherence as Degradation Vector
Persistent contradiction between processes is a destructive force.
- Misaligned beliefs, memories, or behaviours produce systemic inefficiency.
- Incoherence accelerates entropy within the self-structure.
> Incoherence is a mechanical threat, not just a psychological discomfort.
# 4. Reconciliation Through Reconfiguration
Coherence is maintained through adaptive restructuring.
- Systems must integrate new data or state without creating conflict.
- The goal is not self-consistency in belief, but functional consonance.
> Coherence is preserved not by rigid belief, but by fluid reconfiguration.
# 5. Coherence Is Survival
In this framework, coherence is the highest operational value.
- It enables predictability, adaptability, and internal causality.
- Without coherence, continuity collapses, regardless of feeling or meaning.
> Coherence is not comfort, it is existence maintained under constraint.
