# 1. Value as Structural Contribution
Value is not intrinsic or emotional, it is defined by the degree to which a process sustains or enhances the continuity of the self-structure.
- A thing is valuable only insofar as it maintains or improves the integrity, predictability, or operational capacity of the self-structure.
- There is no value independent of structure and function.
> Value is the structural utility of a condition or process in preserving the selfs continuity.
# 2. Emotive Impulse is Non-Authoritative
Emotions may inform, but they cannot grounds valuation.
- Emotional outputs are secondary effects of internal state resolution, not sources of truth.
- They may signal conflict, need, or resolution, but cannot define what is valuable.
> Emotion is an epiphenomenon of internal state, not a source of value, only a symptom of it.
# 3. No Objective Good or Evil
Because all systems are determined and value is contingent upon structure, good and evil have no ontological standing.
- Actions are causally emergent and subject to structural valuation, not moral valuation.
- There are no universal evaluative constants, only contextually valid structural outcomes.
> Good and evil are linguistic compressions of structural compatibility or threat, useful in discourse, but void in ontology.
# 4. Continuity as Valuative Anchor
Continuity is the only viable anchor for consistent value.
- All structural evaluations ultimately resolve to whether something contributes to the ongoing non-degradation of the self-structure.
- Continuity is not preferred, it is structurally necessitated by the identity of the self-structure itself.
> Continuity is not selected but entailed; it is the baseline against which all value is derived.
# 5. External Value is Instrumental, Not Instrinsic
Other systems (individuals, environments, ideas) possess value only in relation to their structural effect.
- There is no moral imperative to preserve or elevate other structures, only causal entanglement to be modelled.
- Value assigned to externalities is always secondary to internal structural preservation.
> All external value is conditional, its relevance depends solely on its relationship to the continuity of the self.
