# 1. Regulation Is Internal Governance
Systems require mechanisms to monitor and adjust themselves.
- Regulation is how a system enforces its own coherence.
- External control may assist, but internal control sustains.
> A system governs itself or it dissolves.
# 2. Regulation Operates Through Feedback
Sustained control depends on real-time evaluation.
- Feedback loops provide current-state data for internal adjustments.
- Without feedback, regulation becomes inertial or chaotic.
> Regulation requires knowing what is happening, not what was.
# 3. Regulation Defines Acceptable Deviation
Stability does not mean stasis, it means bounded variation.
- Every system tolerates flux within a defined range.
- Regulation ensures variance does not exceed these limits.
> It is not fluctuation that destroys, but excess.
# 4. Regulation Prioritises System Integrity
Choices are made in favour of preservation, not preference.
- Regulatory structures suppress actions that risk coherence.
- Internal priorities often override immediate stimuli.
> To last, a system must sometimes deny itself.
# 5. Regulation Enables Autonomy
Self-regulating systems depend less on external correction.
- Autonomy increases as regulatory mechanisms mature.
- Independence is the product of internal discipline.
> To self-direct is first to self-limit.
