# 1. Isolation Is Not Absence, But Reduction
Complete isolation is physically untenable, some interface is always present.
- Isolation is therefore selective attenuation, not nullification.
- The objective is filtration, not severance.
> Isolation begins where indiscriminate contact ends.
# 2. Isolation Preserves Coherence Through Input Control
Environmental exposure destabilises structure when uncontrolled.
- In isolation, the self-structure stabilises into a low-noise state.
- Reconfiguration slows, making continuity more predictable.
> Isolation is environmental silence, clarity emerges in quiet.
# 3. Isolation Does Not Equal Autonomy
Autonomy is about input control, not absence of input.
- Isolation can support autonomy but is not sufficient by itself.
- A coherent internal model still requires periodic interaction to prevent stagnation.
> Autonomy uses isolation as a tool, not as identity.
# 4. Isolation Can Be Structurally Therapeutic
Short-term isolation permits recalibration following distortion.
- It interrupts reinforcing loops that were misaligned.
- Recovery is structural, based on noise extraction, not emotional resolution.
> Isolation repairs by halting the damage, not soothing the wound.
# 5. Isolation Risks Fragility Through Underexposure
Total minimisation of interface impairs adaptive capacity.
- Unexercised pathways atrophy, reintroduction of contact becomes structurally violent.
- Isolation must be calibrated, not pursued to completion.
> Structures left untested decays inwardly.
