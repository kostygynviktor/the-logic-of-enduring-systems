# 1. Action Is Consequence, Not Expression
Action is not a communicative gesture, it is an effect of structural alignment.
- Internal configurations, once resolved, produce mechanical outcomes.
- The appearance of intention is irrelevant to the operation.
> Action is not performed, it is released.
# 2. Output Reflects System Integrity
The form and consistency of action mirror the structure that produced them.
- Coherent systems act with continuity; incoherent systems produce contradiction or collapse.
- Output reveals the internal state, whether accurate or degraded.
> What a system does discloses what a system is.
# 3. Action Modifies Environment and Self
Actions alter the causal field and feed back into the structure.
- Every output modifies both the world and the actor.
- Behaviour is self-refining or self-eroding, depending on alignment with continuity.
> Action is not the end of a process, it is the loop point of iteration.
# 4. Inaction Is Not Absence
Inaction is not non-decision, it is the result of a resolved state.
- Stillness, silence, delay, or detachment are all active outcomes of converged conditions.
- All states emit behaviour, even if that behaviour is to maintain stasis.
> Inaction is behaviour resolved through the same deterministic mechanism as overt action, differing only in external magnitude, not internal process.
# 5. The Self Persists Through Effect
A self-structure that does not act decays.
- Continuity is enforced through causal presence.
- Action maintains system boundary and environmental legibility.
> The self must act to exist as structure within structure.
