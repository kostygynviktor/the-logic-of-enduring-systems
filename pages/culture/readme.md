# 1. Culture Is the Compression of Distributed Memory
Culture stores recurring patterns into transmissible units.
- It reduces the burden of individual memory and invention.
- Norms, rituals, symbols, and language compress complex processes.
> Culture is memory without the need to remember.
# 2. Culture Aligns Independent Agents
Shared cultural frameworks synchronise autonomous behaviours.
- It enables coordination without constant negotiation.
- Culture becomes an invisible scaffolding for group action.
> To share culture is to move without friction.
# 3. Culture Is Adaptive Propagation
Culture evolves through selection of fit behaviours.
- It mutates, spreads, and refines through trial and transmission.
- Adaptation is cultural when it is retained beyond the individual.
> Culture survives by fitting into what survives.
# 4. Culture Reinforces System Identity
Persistent culture defines system boundaries over time.
- It delineates "inside" from "outside", shaping interface responses.
- Identity at scale emerges from cultural distinctiveness.
> Culture is identity scaled across agents.
# 5. Culture Must Be Maintained Intentionally
Left unchecked, culture drifts or decays.
- Transmission mechanisms must be reinforced against distortion.
- Curation and intentional regeneration prevent incoherence.
> Culture without care becomes entropy in disguise.
