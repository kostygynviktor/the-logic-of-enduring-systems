# 1. Language Encodes Compressed Abstraction
Language packages complex relations into minimal forms.
- Words are pointers to layered internal structures.
- Syntax and grammar coordinate shared abstraction rules.
> Language is compression that can still be unfolded.
# 2. Language Enables Synchronised Cognition
It permits alignment of internal states across agents.
- Language allows thought to be shared, not just inferred.
- Communicable structures facilitate distributes cognition.
> Thought becomes networked through language.
# 3. Language Shapes Perception and Memory
Language imposes structure on what is perceived and retained.
- Categories defined linguistically alter cognitive priorities.
- The architecture of recall is scaffolded by available terms.
> What is unnamed may remain unseen.
# 4. Language Evolves Alongside Utility
It mutates in response to usage demands.
- Jargon, metaphor, and syntax drift with context and environment.
- Communication becomes increasingly specialised across domains.
> Language adapts to what it needs to say.
# 5. Language Is a Tool of Control
Framing through language guides interpretation and behaviour.
- Narrative dominance determines perceived truth.
- Power is often encoded in who names and defines.
> To command language is to shape thought.
