# 1. Agency is a Functional Illusion
What is called "agency" is the system-level behaviour of a self-structure acting in accordance with internal and external causality.
- There is no "choice" in a metaphysical sense, only the appearance of choice as preference-conditioned output.
- Agency is experienced, not exercised.
> Agency is not free will, it is the deterministic unfolding of internal state in response to environmental input.
# 2. Decision is Causal, Not Volitional
Every decision is a result, not an act.
- Options do not compete in and autonomous space; outcomes are determined by weighted structural predispositions.
- There is no internal agent selecting between options, only system resolution.
> A decision is the conclusion of structural process, not the selection of a chooser.
# 3. Responsibility is Structurally Descriptive
Responsibility does not imply authorship, it indicates causal origin within a system.
- To be responsible is to be the source of output, not the moral agent behind it.
- Attribution of responsibility is useful for mapping outcomes, not for moral judgement.
> Responsibility tracks cause, not intent; it is diagnostic, not ethical.
# 4. Compulsion and Choice Differ in Scale, Not Kind
What is labelled "compulsion" and "choice" are both outcomes of deterministic computation, distinguished only by visibility of cause.
- Conscious deliberation is not freedom, only delay and complexity in output generation.
- All outputs, impulsive or deliberative, are equivalently determined.
> Compulsion and deliberation are structurally identical, differing only in causal transparency.
# 5. Agency is Instrumental, Not Foundational
Agency is a tool for modelling system behaviour, not a property of systems themselves.
- It allows prediction and explanation but does not imply self-authorship.
- Treating agency as foundational introduces unnecessary metaphysical baggage.
> Agency is a descriptive abstraction, not an ontological entity.
