# 1. Convergence Is a Product of Sustained Coherence
Disparate elements cannot unify without internal consistency.
- Only coherent subsystems can align without distortion.
- Fragmented parts cannot converge, they collide.
> Unity emerges from internal integrity.
# 2. Convergence Requires Compatible Ontologies
Alignment is only possible across shared foundational structures.
- Interfacing systems must resolve fundamental assumptions before cooperation.
- Without ontological compatibility, convergence degrades into misalignment.
> Nothing truly aligns without first agreeing on what is.
# 3. Convergence Is Not Homogenisation
Alignment preserves distinction within a shared trajectory.
- Convergence does not mean sameness, it means directed integration.
- Diversity is retained, but oriented.
> Difference is not opposition when convergence is the goal.
# 4. Convergence Amplifies Systemic Function
Aligned systems produce emergent capabilities.
- Coherence across multiple structures compounds their effectiveness.
- Converging paths multiply, rather than merely sum.
> What moves together moves further.
# 5. Convergence Is Directional, Not Inevitable
Unification is not a given, it is a sustained act of orientation.
- Systems drift apart without active convergence.
- Entropy favours divergence, convergence must be chosen and maintained.
> To converge is to commit to unity.
